# Discord Bot Ticket-System

> A simple ticket system for your Discord bot.

## How to use the Code:

1. Download the zip file from GitHub and unzip it.
2. Check whether your version in README.md matches the [current version](https://https://github.com/Ben4oo/discord-ticketsystem/edit/main/README.md#Version), otherwise download the latest version.
3. Open the file `TicketBot.ini` and adjust **ALL** values in the **[Config]** section.   
4. Execute the file `mainbuildergamesbot.py`: ```sh python3 mainbuildergamesbot.py & ```
5. I would recommend always checking that your version is up to date! [Current Version](https://https://github.com/Ben4oo/discord-ticketsystem/edit/main/README.md#Version)
